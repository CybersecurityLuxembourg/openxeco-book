## OpenXeco Glossary
This glossary is meant as a quick lookup document in case of any need of clarification of any ecosystem, market intelligence lingo.
Be careful when adding terms to the glossary. Adding a generic term like: *openXeco* will prevent terms like *openXeco taxonomy* to be addded. As a matter of definition please use the singular for any terms.
In case you use any CCBYSA licensed content, or other pieces that are subject to licensing, make sure to add it as a by-line at the end of the mention.

## API
OpenXeco makes extensive use of its RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) both internally and provides an external API for automation, synchronisation or any other tasks requiring a machine to machine interface.
In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components. A good [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer. An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware or software library.

## RESTful
Representational state transfer ([REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)) or RESTful web services are a way of providing interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. REST-compliant Web services allow requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. Other forms of Web services exist which expose their own arbitrary sets of operations such as WSDL and SOAP.

## IOC
Indicator of compromise (IOC or IoC) is an artefact observed on a network or in an operating system or information channel that could reference an intrusion or a reference to a technique used by an attacker. IoCs are a subset of indicators.

## NIDS
Network Intrusion Detection System eg. Snort, Suricata

## Malware Information Sharing Platform and Threat Sharing
Malware Information Sharing Platform and Threat Sharing. Commonly known simply as MISP.

## OSINT
[Open-source intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) (OSINT) is data collected from publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context.[1] In the intelligence community, the term "open" refers to overt, publicly available sources (as opposed to covert or clandestine sources). It is not related to open-source software or public intelligence.
OSINT under one name or another has been around for hundreds of years. With the advent of instant communications and rapid information transfer, a great deal of actionable and predictive intelligence can now be obtained from public, unclassified sources.

## Community
A community is composed of the local organisations on a openXeco server and the remote organisations connected by the sync users.
