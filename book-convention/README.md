# Convention Used in This Book

`code block or value`

* Used for variable, function or menu names in openXeco.

## Language

The language in this book is American English.
All the screenshots and examples are in English.

## CoC

The same code of conduct applies to this book as for the main openXeco project.
As a book can some times be considered the inadvertent soul of a piece of software, please take good care and consideration of our `Code of Conduct`. The CoC [can be read here](https://github.com/CybersecurityLuxembourg/openxeco-core/blob/main/code_of_conduct.md).

## Example install

The examples and screenshots provided in this book have been created with the openXeco Autogenerated VM.

## openXeco Instance

In general when talking about a network of inter-connected openXeco servers, each server is an openXeco node. Whilst we have no strong feelings towards anyones naming schemes, as a rule of thumb try to have a scheme that makes everyday use easy when users need to talk about remote openXeco nodes.
<!--
ToDo: Be more specific give some naming convention examples.
-->

The hostname used for the instance in this book is `openxeco.local` and we will henceforth refer to it either by name or as `local openXeco instance`.
